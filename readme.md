 SpyLock â€“ Unauthorized Access Detection System

SpyLock is a Python-based desktop security tool that monitors user activity and detects unauthorized access. If suspicious behavior is detected (e.g., keyboard/mouse activity), the system prompts for a password. After multiple failed attempts, it captures an image using the webcam, locks the system, and sends the photo to a predefined email address.
